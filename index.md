# INTPRN

## An Internet printer

**A publicly accessible printer with Internet access that can receive and print messages. A device for communities and the public realm, to transfer digital information in its analogue context.**

The internet printer is a small device. It is composed of a mini-computer, a thermal printer and a button. It will be installed in the spatial contect of a collective. It shall enable or enhance communication in-between the collective and the collective and its environment.

The printer might be a bridge between the digital sphere and the physical space. Depening on the point of view, the device can be seen as a atavism of communication or as a super-modern artefact that makes invisible, immaterial information layers in urban space tangible. As an experiment this installation addresses the dynamic relationship between digitalisation and social interaction. In this context, it is clearly a social machine, it enhances communities and enables channels of communication to and from the outside.

Check our [Tumblr](https://lest-print-the-internet.tumblr.com/) for a images of the construction and first use cases.

## Development

The project is under development. 

See the github repository [github.com/ut/PRNSTN](https://github.com/ut/PRNSTN) for the ruby script running the printer.

Our next aim is to assemble a prototype with all hardware components needed and to develop a stable/waterproof cover. We'll document the [hardware setup](hardware.html) step by step to make replication of the setup easy and transparent. There is an extra page describing the configuration of the [Raspberry Pi](controller.html). We also develop a stable and waterproof casing for the printer. This setup will be documented soon.

## Credits

The project is kindly supported by [Fabulous St. Pauli](http://www.fablab-hamburg.org/) Hamburg, NEW HAMBURG Festival SOLIPOLIS and by kunst- und kulturverein spedition in Bremen :))
